All right, so I thought I'd just record a few notes in this repository, um, as the year's coming to a close, regarding different things I figured out for, um, baby monitoring at home and different systems, in case this might help, um, any other parents who happen to be on, uh, GitHub and into open source tech. Um, I, um, I want to say that none of this is in any way arguing against commercial solutions for baby monitoring. Um, my wife and I certainly looked at those, and, I mean, I guess we're using, we're using them, um, but it's just kind of patching it into existing systems that I want to talk about like Home Assistant, um, etc. So, and I also want to make a few notes about hardware, uh, just in terms of like what's feasible because I think there is, it's a little bit, um, sometimes what is, um, appears to be kind of easy is, is not actually turns out to be quite complicated, but for reasons that are probably avoidable if, uh, you are, you know, someone who has, um, is prepared to invest in, let's say a dedicated, uh, home piece of in of, of soft, of hardware for, optimized for, uh, stuff like object recognition, which would be, to my mind at least, probably what I would have done in a in a, in the in the best case scenario. Um, so, okay. For video monitoring just a couple of, um, of notes. So, uh, we had a few IP cameras around the house for home security when we were, when we were away, the, uh, Tapo C210. And, uh, when we had Ezra, Ezra is about five months old for context at the time I'm recording this, um, I noticed the nighttime performance was really, really poor. So I got onto Chat GPT and recommended Reolink and, uh, I have a really strong and totally, um, unbiased recommendation for, for them. I picked up an E1 Pro, um, which has, which has ethernet, which is very recommended and absolutely stellar piece of hardware. The, um, clarity, is, is brilliant, um, in terms of what you can see. Like the room, uh, when Ezra was sleeping in our bedroom, the room would be completely pitch dark that I couldn't see him, but I could just open up my phone and in the Reolink app or Home Assistant could very clearly see that he was okay. Uh, that was how we got into it the first night that, um, he was sleeping very deeply. We were like, oh my gosh, it's kind of a bit, we can't tell if he's moving, uh, God forbid, uh, so, that changed our mind to the advantage of, um, of doing some kind of monitoring. So these, really the kind of I'd say the pain points. So we, we set up a few different cameras based on where Ezra is during the day, so we can if an if any, there's any time where either of us aren't, uh, my wife and I aren't, um, in proximity, that we at least have the camera there that we can kind of keep an eye him, even if it assists for a few minutes. Um, so, one thing to think about, I guess, is the Wi-Fi overhead, um, which is why, again, there's kind of best case best case what I would do if money wasn't a constraint and what I'm doing in practice. If money was not a constraint, I would have nothing on Wi-Fi at all because, uh, even putting two cameras on the network, you're at that 2.4 gigahertz band, especially if you've got Zigbee stuff, um, you're going to quickly get a lot of congestion. And, um, it's a problem that can be very avoided very easily by putting the cameras on power over ethernet. So Reolink great manufacturer, depending where you are in the world, there might be other ones, but that's my, that would be my recommendation there. Um, to keep it on, keep all the, keep all IP camera stuff on ethernet. Um, so then for, so that's kind of the system that I did was, um, used WebRTC, um, which I find a really excellent re-streamer. So basically, because we had a mixture, because we have a mixture of TP Link and Reolink, practically speaking, it's a pain in the backside to be juggling the these kind of apps for, um, for, you know, for just trying to get a unified camera feed. So the first thing both of these apps and my sort of hard criteria for picking up cameras, is that they support RTSP. If you can get an RTSP stream out of the camera, you can integrate it usually with anything. PTZ is another, another bit of an issue. But, um, RTSP friendly. So both TP Link and Reolink haven't had an issue there. And getting those feeds in, um, so initially I tried Frigate, F r i g a t e, uh, which is really a terrific app, um, but I'm running, my home server is basically my old desktop. It's running an i3 and it's got like, uh, Nvidia 1050 GPU and basically, object detection, um, the more cameras, the more over workload you're going to have. And it was, to be honest, really challenging to, like, with Frigate, I kept having to disable things in order to avoid getting it to do what it kind of really wanted to do, which was doing, um, GPU detection. And, ultimately, um, I spent a lot of time trying to get Nvidia to work with it because it's an older GPU, didn't work, tried building, you know, object recognition models, but I eventually said that I really don't have that this much time for this. I tried Scripted as well, S C R Y P T E D, which is a very nice platform, um, but ultimately for, you know, trying to do this on legacy hardware, I actually had the best results by far just using a re-streamer, uh, WebRTC. Advantages are a few advantages. The one is that if you have different manufacturers, um, even if it's, even if the only advantages you're re-streaming, um, in a consistent video and audio codec, that's actually still quite useful. Um, and then you can build your front end to that. So, that layer has been surprisingly robust, and the overhead, um, the computational overhead of even doing a little bit of audio codec re-streaming has been actually remarkably small. So, object recognition, quickly discovered it wasn't, wasn't a non-runner for me. Um, there is something called the, uh, Coral TPU from Google, Tensor Processing Unit that is really popular with Frigate, and I could not find a TPU just in my locality for at all. Uh, so, it wasn't something I could find on the markets. Um, but if you can get one of those, I guess that kind of makes a lot of sense for, for making Frigate work. Um, the other thing that's really useful is, um, that you can add to a stack is MQTT. Uh, of course. Um, and the other thing I would say from my experience doing this is object recognition, um, I, I kind of, I thought this is a good, this is a chance to learn a bit about computer vision and machine learning. So, uh, using a stuffed animal, I, I created a little model for, you know, what we would be worried about, which was, let's say that our son experimented with non-motion recognition and with, um, stuff like, uh, pulling a blanket over their face. The stuffed animal, as in that would be the warning condition, let's say. Um, and eventually just didn't really, those approaches is really trick, like you're going to get, as soon as you get into false positives, the system's going to create more stress than it solves. And what I ultimately actually found the best success with was simple facial recognition. Not, and that sounds very creepy because we're talking about a newborn, but not actually recognizing his specific face, but in auto-cropping script that I added, which basically says, um, if there's a face in the frame, that's the active camera, and we're going to crop in a little bit on the face. So that's actually quite easy to integrate. And it just means that you can have a little monitor if you're working at night, like I'm a big night owl, and whatever, wherever that your newborn is detected, that will be Boolean positive, and it'll crop a little bit. And then I find that just like there's no technology that can kind of substitute for just seeing, you know, that everything's okay and then periodically going in to check on him. And, um, when he was waking up at nighttime, we'd kind of see if he was putting himself back to sleep or needed to to get back up. So both my wife and I have found it a really invaluable asset actually. Um, then for cry detection, so, okay, audio, audio object detection is actually easier, um, than a lot easier than video, um, in the sense that you can run it on a CPU at a push. And there's two things really if you, like if you're trying to if, if you're trying to get cry notifications, in the, in our case, I keep trying to, you know, not create technological solutions that are like no better than just using your, your ears. And, um, so for cry detection, you can, there are some data sets that will have that cry object. Um, but if there's, if there's, if you're just trying to, you know, in our case, let's say our, our, our son Ezra is in a quiet room and it's just easier to do volume detection. Like whether that counts as a cry or a or a coo or a scream, the risk with doing, um, trying to be too smart with sound detection, is exactly that. You're going to, it's going to classify audio events incorrectly. So the most blunt form way to do it is just to volume based detection and just like, you know, record a few seconds. Wait for your baby to cry, measure the decibels, and set that as your threshold for triggering an alert if you want to go down that route. And MQTT and Home Assistant all this can be done very easily. Um, you can have write a script that if the audio passes this level. And then for baby, for, for cry monitoring, so, um, my wife bought like a little monitor, and we actually ended up using, home system, home DIY system ended up actually being just as useful. And the system I use is as follows. So if you have a Reolink or a TP Link camera, um, it's probably putting out an audio stream. So I highly recommend just using Cloud or Chat GPT to do all the hard work and say, hey, this is the IP address. And I should have included that in my notes here. Highly very important, um, assign fixed IP addresses for your cameras, so stuff isn't moving around unpredictably. Uh, so you can say like 1000 22, can you tell me what, uh, audio codec and what, what the audio is streaming at? And once you've identified that, um, in WebRTC, you can have an audio only re-stream. But, um, I actually find it more effective to do an Icecast server. It's pretty old tech, um, but the issue with having stuff like FFMPEG streaming it like that is that if the client drops, stream might drop. So putting an Icecast server, um, means that the stream's always good. And you can even do a little bit of, um, down sampling. So you might find that the camera puts out, uh, the audio feed is, is actually unnecessarily heavy in terms of the bit rate, and you can actually have an Icecast server just get it down to the bare minimum that you can hear audio events clearly. It doesn't need to be, you know, beautiful quality audio. And then what I, what we do in practice is using VLC on our phone, you can just bookmark the Icecast server MP3 stream, um, save that and then just have your phone open overnight, leave it on, leave it running in the background, test it, it works. And it's basically a DIY cry monitor. Like you'll hear, um, it comes through very clearly. We also did it to a speaker in our bedroom, and that was a little bit, uh, too noisy. Um, phone, the phone system works really, really well. It's fast, it's over the local network. Um, it's a lightweight audio server, streaming audio. You can just open that on your phone or whatever you want to use, and, um, you know, you won't miss that. I think it works more effectively and reliably than the thing that my wife bought, but then again I would say that. So those are my notes so far. Uh, hope that is helpful to someone maybe, and I'll use our friendly AI tool to, uh, to summarize and gather together the information. Um, I think the main thing I've learned really is from the start it's just about a few little, um, it's about kind of common sense tech as in getting a reliable way to watch a video stream and getting a reliable way to hear if they're crying than trying to go, go too complex and AI detection and vision. I just find it was computationally too much and you, you know, it's just about getting up something that's actually usable and viable. In Home Assistant Advanced camera card is a great app for folks who don't have, uh, PTZ cameras. Uh, my, my ones aren't PTZ. Um, and you can do digital zoom on that, which is actually quite neglected in IP camera viewers because I think most of them are, are built for proper sort of surveillance systems where everything has PTZ. Um, but if your cameras don't, the Reolink and the Tapo link have it's, uh, it is tilt and pan TP technically, it doesn't have true optical zoom, that's controllable, whether through the app or through a third party. And, um, that's something I had to actually build into a little front end monitoring GUI that I created. Um, and, uh, in terms of two-way audio and, um, pan and zoom control, it's kind of hit and miss to be honest. Um, there is like ONVIF, ONVIF, that protocol. And there are on GitHub, um, unofficial, uh, API wrappers for the cameras, but, um, it's a bit tricky to get that working, but in theory, um, you should be able to control a camera and add that functionality into any, um, external tool as well, but it it really depends on a camera by camera basis. And if you're building, if you're picking out gear or hardware for this purpose, like with the idea of integrating it into a existing smart home, I think as always, probably the best bet is to go on Reddit, uh, the, you know, the, uh, and GitHub and see what people recommend is the most flexible, uh, manufacturer for allowing you to actually sort of use what you pay for. The other concern I had with, uh, IP cameras is just kind of getting like data leaving the network. Um, and I think I did a, I did a pretty decent audit to make sure the cameras, uh, disable the cloud. But that's something again that in a best case scenario, um, I would actually look for tech that doesn't have, if that's a concern for you for privacy, um, no cloud hooking whatsoever and you really, the only way, I think that's the only way to be relatively certain that your camera feeds are going where you hope they are and not somewhere else, is to not have any of these kind of convenience features from the manufacturers. Um, and then for streaming it out of the network, um, uh, Tailscale is a brilliant, um, is a fantastic tool because you can just, um, have it on your phone, connect to your tail net, and then just use the, put in the IP address and IP camera Pro for Android is a terrific app as well. So that combination will allow you to remotely monitor, um, and, and then you don't need to do any of the Tailscale stuff. And then for local viewing, gosh, there's a lot of information that I realized I've kind of picked up about this. MSC is a, is a really decent protocol, you'll get very good speed. But the name, the, the golden rule is that, uh, for low latency monitoring at home, um, RT RTSP and WebRTC will re-stream RTSP as well as the other protocol. So it really gives you all the options for however you want to consume and aggregate your, uh, your streams and you can even do something like, uh, you can even do kind of just, uh, if you have more, uh, underlying computation to work with on the device you're doing the re-streaming, you can absolutely re-stream a cropped in stream, re-stream it with some video, you know, editing the saturation, the all that stuff, um, is possible. So it's actually I would say one of the most helpful components. So my, my stack that I recommend or the stack that I, that is this the the the stellar options for me would be, I would say RTSP, WebRTC, MQTT, Icecast, Home Assistant, and with those components you can kind of do pretty much everything.
